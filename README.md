Nov 5, 2025: Query to add Goal (Is the current level as I'm performing lower level exercises, it keeps going up, trying to see if it takes more than 3 days, so I will eventually catch up to current)

Add new DB entry for Goal Level, it should be same type as Level and Day at Level.
Add a third numeric entry to the right of Day at Level for this Goal Level.
When record today's level is pressed save all 3.
Also Last Recorded Level should show Level 15 (Day 2) of 23 for Level of 15, Day at level of 2, and Goal Level of 23.

Each History entry should show Lvl: 15, Day: 2 of 23
If there is no Goal level for that day, don't show the of and number.

This resulted in the changes in this commit.
